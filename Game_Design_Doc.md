# Game Design Document
Mushroom Man may need some more TLC as far as animation goes. 

Name of the game should reflect how the gameplay works. 

Want the game to feel atmospherically gloomy, like a bunch of mushroom stuffs, but light hearted because the graphics suck. 

I wouldn't say gloomy, I'd say... Darker. Dark muted colors. 

I think we should give the mushroom a stick as a spear. We should give him a mushroom shield, or something else shieldlike if we can think of one. 

Bad guys can be blue mushrooms, snails, slugs, plants. If you step in a bacteria, it can start to drain away your health if you don't do something soon enough. (Get some water droplets or something.)

I want it to feel like an interesting game but simple. I don't think boss fights are important, at least not for something this basic. 

I think we're going to go with a platformer with almost no story. Maybe he finds himself in a cave in. 
He tries to get out but most of the mushrooms he finds are acting as carnivores. He has to go through a tunnel at the end of each level, perhaps getting closer and closer to the surface, where he finds (his wife and kids, the sun, idk).

Gameplay should feel smooth, methodical, slow paced, and satisfying. Should feel progression, some interesting jumps, interesting level design that's not too complicated but that rewards you for exploring. Need a way to direct the player towards goals.
